You can construct your resume more captivating by acting on the following: -
Paper quality.
Resume proofreading.

Clarity of place and dates.
Professional email address.
Skills

All these steps should be taken care of while writing a CV so that it becomes hard for the hiring manager to ignore your CV at any cost.
